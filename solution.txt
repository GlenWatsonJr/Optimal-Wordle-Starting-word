***If you reading this, there is a flaw that makes this not optimal.  I was counting each letter in word, including duplicates
in order to get the optimal solution I need to count each letter in a word once.  **2nd update, Also the optimal word should have the 
most correct positioned letter(green squares) in all the answers also. Technically "raise" would be the optimal starting word with 3 vowels.***
